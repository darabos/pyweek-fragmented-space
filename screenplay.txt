- I'm in the car, Bob. I'll be with you in 5 minutes and we can make the deal. Yeah, yeah, I'll defragment my drive on the way.

- The deal was a setup! He's dead! Bob's dead! I'll get those CIA thugs for this! Just let me defragment first...

[Opening box.]
- Haha! Yes! I got every last one of the CIA thugs! Found a hard drive too. I know! I'll defragment it!

- Bob wouldn't believe how deep this goes... I'm in the alien mothership now. I'll try to connect to their storage system to defragment it.

[Creepy crawly.]
- And now I'm stranded on Mars. Just great. How will I ever get home? I guess there's plenty of time to defragment the ship's computer at least.

[Sand running from hand.]
- Ah, nothing like a swim in the sea and a well deserved beer! I needed this before facing the AI. Oh, I got to remember to defragment the drive too!
